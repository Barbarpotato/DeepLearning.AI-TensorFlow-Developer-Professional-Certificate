# Course-2

# Week-1 (Using CNN's with the Cats vs Dogs Dataset)
This week, you will be using the famous `Cats vs Dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.

# Week-2 (Tackle Overfitting with Data Augmentation)
As in the previous week, you will be using the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities, more so this time around since Keras provides excellent support for augmenting image data.

# Week-3 (Transfer Learning and Dropout Techniques)
Welcome to this assignment! This week, you are going to use a technique called `Transfer Learning` in which you utilize an already trained network to help you solve a similar problem to the one it was originally trained to solve.

# Week-4 (Multi-class Classification)
In this exercise, you will get a chance to work on a multi-class classification problem. You will be using the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the english alphabet.
